\section Description Description
This program is designed to calculate various baryonic properties associated with dark matter
structures identified by STF/VElOCIraptor. NOTE: that at the moment, it is coded such that it assumes
baryons are always associated with a dark matter structure if the ibaryon flag in the options structure
is set to 1. That is, the files are split in two structure files and associated baryon files. However,
if the output is not split into separate files, then the structures can be composed of ANY type of particle
